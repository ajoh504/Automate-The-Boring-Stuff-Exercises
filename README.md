# Automate-The-Boring-Stuff-Exercises
A repository containing all of my code from the exercises in Al Sweigart's Automate the Boring Stuff With Python

A big thank you to the author, Al Sweigart, for the resources contained in his book, Automate the Boring Stuff 
With Python. A link to the free ebook and can be found here: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ 
The book can also be purchased from No Starch Press: https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2

Note: In some instances, I changed the code syntax from how it's written in the book, mainly as a way to think 
about the code differently so as to help me learn.
