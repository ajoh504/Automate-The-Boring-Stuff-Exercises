# Automate-The-Boring-Stuff-Exercises
A repository containing my solutions from the exercises in Al Sweigart's book, Automate the Boring Stuff With Python. In some instances, I changed the code syntax, variable names, and other items from how they're written in the book, mainly as a learning tool to force myself to think about the code differently.

A big thank you to the author for the resources contained in his book. [A link to the free ebook can be found here.](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) The book can also be purchased [directly from the publisher, No Starch Press.](https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2) The author occasionally posts free download codes for the [accompanying video series](https://inventwithpython.com/) over at [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/).

I submitted some of my code in the Code Review section on Stack Exchange, listed as follows:
