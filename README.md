# Automate-The-Boring-Stuff-Exercises
A repository containing solutions to the exercises in Al Sweigart's book, Automate the Boring Stuff With Python. In some instances, the code syntax, variable names, and other items have been changed, mainly as a learning tool to think about the code differently.
