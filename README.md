# Automate-The-Boring-Stuff-Exercises
A repository containing all of my code from the exercises in Al Sweigart's book, Automate the Boring Stuff With Python.

A big thank you to the author for the resources contained in his book. A link to the free ebook and can be found here: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ 
The book can also be purchased from No Starch Press: https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2

Note: In some instances, I changed the code syntax, variable names, and list items from how they're written in the book, mainly as a learning tool to force myself to look at the code differently.
